# Geogram-Frontend

Geogram aims to solve this problem by providing a platform for users to discover and connect with like-minded individuals nearby. By using geolocation technology, Geogram enables users to find people with similar interests and values in their vicinity. The app's messaging and profile view features provide a platform for users to get to know each other and build meaningful relationships beyond a simple follow or like.

Kind of inspired from pokemon go.
